Alternatively, use [**Sublime Merge**](https://www.sublimemerge.com/) for a GUI-based Git experience.

### 3. Start XAMPP Services

Open the XAMPP Control Panel and **start Apache and MySQL**.

### 4. Database Setup

1. Go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`
2. Create a new database named:

```
hotelrms
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Do **not** use symbols or spaces in the database name due to installer validation.

### 5. Run the Installer

1. Switch to the installation branch:

```bash
git checkout installation-branch
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost/hotel-rms/install/
```

3. Follow the on-screen steps:
   - Enter your database credentials.
   - Complete the installation.
   - Use **any key and ID** (this is a **nulled version** for testing only).
   - Remember your **username/email** and **password** for logging in later.

### 6. Final Steps

- After successful installation, **delete the `install` directory** from the project folder.
- Switch back to the `main` branch:

```bash
git checkout main
```

## ‚úÖ You're Ready to Go!
